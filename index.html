            <p>My name is Mau and I am a first-year graphic design student. I am passionate about the feild and look forward to a successful career. I am uncertain if I want to work freelance or if I want to work with an agency. I don't know where the future will take me, but the unknown and potential for the future excites me. </p>

            <p>Other than graphic design, I enjoy hobbies such as painting and reading. These are activities that take up much of my freetime. I am also in the process of learning French and Arabic. Wish me luck!</p>
